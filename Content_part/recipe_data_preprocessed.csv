2018-06-11,C135,Bean and vegetable tacos with homemade tortillas,medium,main,vegetarian,american,"blending,frying,sauteing","We start by making a tomato base to cook the rice in. Throw some of the onion, tomatoes, chili peppers, garlic, salt, and water into a blender and blitz to combine. The next step is to cook the rice. In a frying pan, fry a bit of onion in oil and then add the rice. Fry for approx. 2 min. Add the tomato base, bring to a boil and simmer until the rice is cooked. Next, we will make the tortillas. Mix the masa harina, water, and salt in a bowl until you get an elastic consistency. Then roll the dough into smaller balls. Grab two flat surfaces (such as cutting boards) to flatten the tortillas, or use a rolling pin. Stack your tortillas with plastic wrap in between so they don’t stick together. Heat the tortillas in a nonstick pan on both sides. Store them in a clean kitchen towel to keep fresh while you prepare the vegetables and beans. Next, we will make the beans. Cut the onion. Drain and rinse the beans, heat some oil in a pan, fry the onion, then add the beans and mash them in the pan, or leave them whole because they will still taste great. Finally, we will make the veggies. We just like to sauté whatever vegetables we have in the fridge and in this case we will use carrot, onion, chili peppers, bell pepper, zucchini, mushrooms, and garlic. Chop all vegetables. Add oil to your pan, then add garlic, chili, and all the vegetables that take longer to cook first, like onions and carrots. Sauté for a few minutes, then add the rest and fry until soft. Season to taste with paprika powder, chili powder, garlic powder, salt, and pepper. Now that everything is ready, we will assemble the tacos. Take tortilla and add beans, rice, veggies, and top it off with cilantro and lime. Enjoy! Want to share your recipe with our awesome community?

Wipe a large bowl and the whisk attachment of a stand mixer with a paper towel with a few drops of lemon juice. This eliminates any grease. Put the egg whites in the bowl and whisk until foamy, about 30 sec. Add the cream of tartar and whisk again on medium speed for about 1 min. or until soft peaks form. Increase the speed to high and add one tablespoon of sugar at a time, mixing well in between each spoon full. Beat until thick and glossy. Add the almond extract and whisk for another 30 sec. Use a large round decorating tip and fill a piping bag with the mixture and pipe it on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Hold the piping bag up straight to form the perfect meringue and continue to pipe until you get a size of about 5-cm/2-in. Bake for 90 min. at 90°C/200°F, making sure you don’t open the door as this will let heat escape. Once the time is up, turn off the oven but leave the meringues in there for a further 1 hr.

There’s one thing I can assure you: The Kitchen Stories crew takes no prisoners. We ate it all. Everything. It was an equally formidable and brutal assertion of man’s dominance over the food chain. However, victory soon turned into bitter-sweet agony, as we squirmed on the ground, swearing to never touch Chinese food again—at least for the next couple of weeks.

And, as we’re slowly emerging from our food comas, we yet again feel that strong urge to crank up the stove, whip out the wok, and just stir fry away.

Yet, it is by far the number one place for every aficionado to pig out on a wide variety of different kinds of za. Since its introduction to the US by Italian immigrants in the late 19th century, pizza has steadily grown in popularity, and is by now considered a staple of American cuisine. The original Neapolitan pizza remains a universally loved and cherished dish; however, every region boasts its own unique recipe, which sometimes strays from what is considered to be the real deal. While New York-style pizza, with its thin, flexible crust and southern Italian-style marinara sauce, comes closest to the original, Chicago-style pizza stands in a category of its own. Also known as Chicago deep dish pizza, it doubles down on everything: a thick pie-like crust serves as a foundation for copious amounts of chunky tomato sauce, cheese and other toppings such as onions, bell peppers, and mushrooms.

2017-04-10,R440,Ombré cake,medium,dessert,,,"baking,oven","Set butter and eggs out to reach room temperature. Preheat oven to 175°C/350°F. Butter cake pans, line bottoms with parchment paper, and dust with flour, tapping out excess. Whisk together flour, baking powder, and salt and set aside. Cream some of the butter and sugar until smooth, then add eggs one at a time, beating well after each. Stir in some of the vanilla and continue to beat for another couple of minutes until light and fluffy. Add flour mixture to butter mixture in thirds, alternating with some of the milk, until all is combined. To dye cake layers, divide batter evenly among four bowls. Tint each bowl a different hue by gradually increasing number of drop of food coloring you add to each bowl. Transfer batter to cake pans. Bake cakes for approx. 20 – 30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in center of cakes comes out clean. Let cakes cool in pans for approx. 10 minutes before turning them out to cool completely on cooling rack. To make buttercream, beat sugar and butter on low speed until combined, then increase speed to medium and beat until light and fluffy. Add some of the milk, vanilla, and salt, and mix for another minute or two. If buttercream is too stiff, add a little milk; if it’s too loose, add a little more sugar. When cakes are cool, level them by slicing a thin, even layer of off of their tops. Dab some buttercream onto center of cake board and place darkest cake on top of it. Spread even layer of buttercream over the cake, then place next lightest cake on top. Continue this way until lightest cake is on top. Stick cake in refrigerator to chill for at least 15 minutes. When cake is chilled, coat outside with remaining buttercream, reserving a small amount if you’d like to write on cake later. Refrigerate for approx. 15 minutes. Dust work surface and fondant with powdered sugar and knead until satiny and smooth, dusting more powdered sugar onto work surface as needed. Roll fondant evenly until it is at least the diameter of cake plus two times the height. Use a sewing needle or pin to deflate any air bubbles. Trim excess. Drape fondant over rolling pin and transfer it over cake, making sure it covers all sides with plenty of overhang. Remove pleats from fondant by lifting fondant up and smoothing it along sides of cake all the way around. Use a sharp paring knife to trim off excess fondant up to about 1.25-cm or ½-inch from bottom of the cake. Use a bench scraper, fondant smoother, or your hands to smooth fondant down toward bottom seam, gently pressing fondant down onto cake board. Trim fondant a bit closer to cake this time, but not all the way to the seam. Continue to smooth fondant down and remove any air bubbles. For final trim, cut the fondant at a 45-degree angle, pulling out any excess away from the board. Transfer cake to serving plate, finish decorating it as you prefer, and enjoy!","['all-purpose flour', 'baking powder', 'butter (divided)', 'butter for greasing', 'eggs', 'flour for dusting', 'fondant (dyed pink)', 'pink food coloring for dyeing', 'powdered sugar', 'powdered sugar for dusting', 'salt (divided)', 'sugar', 'vanilla extract (divided)', 'whole milk (divided)']",14,513

Combine milk, some of the egg whites, and some of the vanilla bean seeds; whisk until blended. Whisk together flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt. On low speed, gradually add some of the butter and mix until it resembles moist crumbs. Add half of the milk mixture and beat on medium speed for approx. 2 minutes. Add second half and beat for approx. 1 minute longer. Scrape down sides of bowl, then beat mixture for approx. 30 more seconds. Divide batter evenly between the 8-inch/20-cm pans. Bake for approx. 30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into center of cake comes out clean. Let cool for approx. 10 minutes before turning out onto cooling rack. Allow to cool completely before removing parchment paper from the bottom of cakes and wrapping tightly in plastic wrap. Chill in refrigerator for at least 30 minutes or up to 5 days; or store in freezer for up to 2 weeks. Make batter two more times, each time baking one 6-inch/15-cm and one 10-inch/25-cm cake together. The 6-inch/15-cm cakes will bake for approx. 20 minutes, and the 10-inch/25-cm cakes will bake for approx. 40 minutes. To make buttercream, fill pot with a few inches of water and bring to a slow simmer. In heat proof bowl or bowl of stand mixer, combine egg whites and sugar. Place bowl over pot of simmering water. Heat mixture, stirring constantly, until the mixture reaches 70°C/160°F or the sugar is completely dissolved. Transfer bowl to stand mixer or use hand mixer to beat egg whites, gradually increasing speed, until they form stiff peaks and bowl and meringue have cooled to the touch. With mixer running, add vanilla, then add butter gradually, until all is incorporated and buttercream is light and smooth. This can take time; continue to beat until it comes together. Make the buttercream recipe one more time. Store in airtight container if not using immediately, though fresh buttercream is best for decorating. Assemble each tier: level each cake by slicing off a thin, even layer off top to create a level surface. Cut each cake in half so each tier has four layers. For each tier, smear a dab of buttercream onto corresponding cake board. Place first layer of cake down on top of cake board, then spread thin layer of jam onto it. Place next layer of cake on top and spread a layer of buttercream on top. Continue until tier is complete and place in refrigerator to chill. Repeat with each tier. Apply a crumb coat to each tier by spreading a thin layer of buttercream over the tops and sides. Scrape and clean spatula as you go to prevent spreading more crumbs into buttercream. Place tiers in refrigerator for at least 30 minutes to firm up before proceeding. When tiers are firm, frost each with final layer of buttercream in the style you prefer. Return tiers to refrigerator to firm up for at least an hour or up to 24 hours. When tiers are firm, prepare to insert straw dowels: Measure and mark the 10-inch/25-cm tier by centering an empty 8-inch/20-cm cake pan over it and pressing down gently to mark where that tier will go. Do the same with an empty 6-inch/15-cm pan over the 8-inch/20-cm tier. Just inside the marks on the 10-inch/25-cm tier, insert straws (or wooden dowels) at 12-, 3-, 6-, and 9-o’clock positions. Mark where cake meets straw, then remove it and trim just below the mark so that it disappears when reinserted in cake. Push straws back into cake. Repeat process with 8-inch/20-cm tier, using 3 straws at 12-, 4-, and 8-o’clock positions. Use buttercream to smooth over holes. To finish cake, place cake board onto cake turntable. Dollop a tablespoon of buttercream onto board and center 10-inch/25-cm tier on top. Dollop another tablespoon of buttercream on top of that tier, and use your hand and an offset spatula to gently lower the 8-inch/20-cm tier on top, making sure that it’s centered.

Add some of the agave nectar and half the vanilla bean paste, along with the almond butter. Mix and combine with the crushed cookies. Add approx. 1 tablespoon of the cookie mixture to each ramekin and firmly press down. Transfer to the freezer for approx. 5 – 10 min. or until frozen solid. Meanwhile, blend blanched almonds in two batches so that half of them are fine and the other half is still a bit chunky. Combine both halves of the blanched almonds with the remaining agave nectar and remaining vanilla bean paste in a bowl. The dough should not be sticky but hold together when pressure is applied (sort of like a dryer and chunkier marzipan). Spoon a tablespoon of almond dough on top of the frozen cookie base in each ramekin. Press down carefully to level out, then chill. Pour the blood orange juice in a saucepan and sweeten with sugar to your preference. Stir in the agar-agar and bring to a boil. Remove from the heat after approx. 1 min. and let cool briefly.
